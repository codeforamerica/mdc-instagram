## Usage

Minimal usage:

```js
var markdown = require('remarked');
console.log(markdown('I am using **remarked**.'));
//=> <p>I am using <strong>remarked</strong>.</p>
```

## API

### .setOptions

Define remarked options with:

```js
remarked.setOptions({})

```js
var remarked = require('remarked');
remarked.setOptions({
  renderer: new remarked.Renderer(),
  gfm: true,
  tables: true,
  breaks: false,
  pedantic: false,
  sanitize: true,
  smartLists: true,
  smartypants: false
});

console.log(remarked('I am using **remarked**.'));
```

## Why?

Assemble used [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked) extensively, but - for a couple of reasons - we've decided to maintain a fork so that our users can have a more reliable experience going forward.

1. There are bugs, like [escaping quotes](https://github.com/chjj/marked/issues/269#issuecomment-47995414) automatically that prevent us from making marked.js a built-in parser.
1. Given the massive amount of time and effort that we've put into fixing marked-related issues on the Assemble project and related projects
1. Breaking changes are introduced to marked.js without bumping the minor version
1. It does too much or too little with certain features. Like [automatically adding ids to headings](https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/181)

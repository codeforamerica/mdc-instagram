Currently, there are three Verb runners to choose from:

* [verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) runs Verb globally from the command line
* [grunt-verb](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-verb) for your favorite JavaScript task runner.
* [gulp-verb](https://github.com/assemble/gulp-verb) for your streaming build systems.

Those tools are great for building docs once they already exist, but you can also use [generator-verb](https://github.com/assemble/generator-verb) to:

* Initialize new Node.js projects _with documentation read-to-go_. This is a great generator for Node.js projects in general, even if you don't want to use Verb!
* Add docs templates to new or existing projects

Read [the documentation](./DOCS.md) to learn more about Verb!

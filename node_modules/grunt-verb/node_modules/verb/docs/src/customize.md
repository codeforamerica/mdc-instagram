Verb is easy to extend, here are some examples ([verb-cli](https://github.com/assemble/verb-cli) will automatically use these):

* [example verbfile](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685280), with custom `src`, `dest` and metadata.
* [example verbfile with logging](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9685144)
* [example .verbrc.yml](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/9686195)

You can also use Verb as a basis for creating your own documentation generator!

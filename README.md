The Shiny Instagram Thing
==================

Intent
------

[Litterati] (http://www.litterati.org/)

There's an ask for an app that tracks especially high king tides in Miami-Dade County. Rather than reinvent the wheel, let's try to tap the [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer/) and a mapping API (to be determined) to build it out.

#### MVP:

Use the Instagram API to track a single, probably hardcoded, hashtag and display those images on a map of Miami-Dade County. Roll it all into a site similar to Litterati.

#### Second:

Admin back-end that allows:
* login
* control over the tracked hashtag
* control over the map display area (for example, instead of #kingtide in Miami, #tarballs in Galveston, etc).
